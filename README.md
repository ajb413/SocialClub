# SocialClub

a [Sails](http://sailsjs.org) application

SocialClub: A basic message board web application.

I wanted to learn how to build a web application using Node.js and MVC. Sails had great documentation and tutorials online. I'm very grateful for Sails!

SocialClub has a concept of users and text posts. Users log in with basic user authentication and can read/create text posts. Users have privileges of "junior" or "senior." Juniors can make posts or delete their own posts, and seniors can moderate by deleting anyone's posts and creating/deleting users. Users have their own car attribute and avatar; It's practically facebook.

SocialClub uses Sails.js, Grunt.Js, Angular.js, jQuery, Q, and hand-written HTML and CSS.
